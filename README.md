In this repl I take a csv file ('100MostStreamedSongs.csv') that contains data from a music streaming service.

My program:
Reads in the data.
Categorizes the songs by artist:
Creates one empty folder per artist.
Creates one blank text file per song by that artist in the relevant folder. The file name of the text file is the name of the song.
